## Hi Everyone

Congratulations on gaining a position at Nouse!  I'm happy to let you know that you're now all set up and ready to go on our systems.

## G Suite
We use G Suite to handle emails, documents and instant messaging.  You'll have received an email from Google to help you pick a password and finish setting up your account if you're a new editor.  If you're an existing editor, G Suite offers exactly the same services that Google Apps did in exactly the same place (just the name has changed).  It is accessed by going to [G Suite](https://mail.google.com/).

Your personal email account is *firstname*.*lastname*@nouse.co.uk.  You'll also automatically receive emails to this account from your section email address, which is *section*@nouse.co.uk.  For more information on G Suite take a look at [G Suite Help](http://writersroom.nouse.co.uk/editors/email/).

## WordPress
WordPress powers our website and helps you write articles.  You can sign in with your username which is *Firstname Lastname* (note your name is camel cased), or with your email address.

If you have previously had a WordPress account with a University of York email address, then this account has been updated to your Nouse email address but your password is unchanged.  If you haven't had a WordPress account before you may have received an email to set-up your WordPress account, which you should follow the instructions of.  If you haven't received an email, then go to [Dashboard](https://www.nouse.co.uk/wp-admin) and click "Lost your Password".  More information is available at [WordPress Help](http://writersroom.nouse.co.uk/writers/wordpress/).  A fuller guide will be published on the linked page soon.

## Writers Room
This year we're introducing something new, Writers Room.  This is a service that should make it easier to access help and other information about Nouse that is relevant to both Writers and Editors.  Information, such as the Style Guide and InDesign information will be published there soon.  Sharing links to Writers Room rather than the documents themselves makes sure everyone always has the latest information.

You can access it now at http://writersroom.nouse.co.uk/.  More information will be added over the coming days.

## Other services
There are other services that you'll likely encounter throughout the year, such as our social media pages, Flickr, Viddyprinter, Account and Fantasy Football.  If you need access to any of these services and I already know then you'll be given access at a later time.  If you need to request access then please get in touch as per below.

## Getting help
If you need help with anything tech related then please contact [support@nouse.co.uk](mailto:support@nouse.co.uk).

## IMPORTANT THINGS TO NOTE
* You should set strong passwords for your G Suite and WordPress accounts.  Strong passwords help protect both ourselves and our readers.
* This is the last email you will receive to your University of York address.  All future emails will go to your Nouse email address only.  Please use your Nouse address for all Nouse related matters from now on.

For more information on Nouse then please take a look at Writers Room.  If you need any help getting set up then please reply to this email.

Thank You

*The Nouse Technical Team*
