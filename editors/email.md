## G Suite
We use G Suite to provide email and other services to make writing and managing Nouse easier.  Your Nouse G Suite account is separate to your University of York or YUSU G Suite accounts.  This means you can use familiar tools such as Gmail, Google Drive, Google Docs and Hangouts to help you with your role.

### Logging-in
To log-in visit the [Google Sign-in screen](https://accounts.google.com/AddSession?hl=en-GB&continue=https://mail.google.com/mail&service=mail#identifier) and enter your email address.  Email addresses are of the form firstname.lastname@nouse.co.uk.  You'll then be asked to provide a password or authorise the login via your phone.

If you are logging in for the first time, you will have been emailed a temporary password.  You'll be required to change this password to log in again.

#### Forgotten Password
You need to email support@nouse.co.uk to receive a new password.  Please send the email from your University of York or YUSU email account as this will greatly speed up the process of verifying your identity.

If you are logged in but cannot remember your password, it can be changed by going to your [My Account](https://myaccount.google.com/) page and following the links to security options.

### Section email addresses
All editors will also receive emails intended for their section.  This email is of the form section@nouse.co.uk.  If you aren't receiving emails you expect to then please get in touch so you group memberships can be checked.

You can also send emails from your section address.  Learn how to set up an [address alias in Gmail](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/22370?hl=en).

### Monitoring and Account Expiry
The Nouse Tech team monitor usage of G Suite to prevent data leakage or misuse.  This is to protect both you and Nouse.

When you leave your position on the editorial team, you will also lose access to your email account.  We can only support a finite number of G Suite accounts at a time so we need to disable old accounts to give new editors access to the same services.  New editors won't be able to see any of your data, however.
