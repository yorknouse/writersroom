During production weeks the office will become your home from home for at least part of it.  We use Adobe InDesign on Apple Macs to lay up the paper.

## Launching InDesign

You can launch InDesign from Finder by going to `Applications -> Adobe -> Adobe CC InDesign 2015 -> Adobe InDesign`.  It is also available from the Dock at the bottom of the screen by clicking on the Pink "Id" button.

If you double click on an InDesign file it will also open it in the latest version of InDesign.  Some machines have older versions of InDesign installed on them as well as the latest version while we upgrade the machines.  Make sure you are always using InDesign 2015.


## Finding Files

Files can be found on the desktop in the `current` and `archive` drives.  You will most likely only need to use the `current` drive which contains everything the current team has worked on.  Files for your section are stored as `Nouse/Muse -> Section -> Publication Date`.

Only one person can have an InDesign file open at a time.  If it just a case of working on text whilst someone else uses a file, then you can use LibreOffice or Microsoft Office to write up articles and copy them in later.

If you save files to Download, Documents or the Desktop then they may be deleted without warning.  Always save important files to the `current` drive.

## Security and Policies

Please remember that, like all other machines on campus, you must follow [University of York Regulation 11 - Use of computing facilities](https://www.york.ac.uk/about/organisation/governance/governance-documents/ordinances-and-regulations/regulation-11/).

In particular, when you have finished with a machine, please make sure you log out of WordPress, G Suite, Facebook and any other accounts you have logged in to.

Any files left saved on machines (not in the `current` drive) will be deleted without notice.  Once files have been deleted from locations other than `current` they cannot and will not be recovered.
