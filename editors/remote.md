If you have Adobe InDesign 2015 installed on a personal device then you can work from home to lay up.

## Requesting Access

You will need to send an email to the Tech Director requesting access every year you are either an Editor or Sub-Editor.  This request needs to come from your Nouse email account and include your University of York IT Services username.

Access is not available for Writers.


## Using Remote working

Once you have been given access you will be given instructions on how to connect.  In breif:

1. Connect to the [VPN Service](https://www.york.ac.uk/it-services/services/vpn/).
2. On Windows open an explorer window and click into the address bar at the top of the window.  On Mac, right click on Finder in the Dock and select "Connect to Server".
3. On Windows, enter the path `\\storage.its.york.ac.uk\yususocs\nouse\current\`.  On Mac, enter the path `smb://storage.its.york.ac.uk/yususocs/nouse/current`.  On both, then hit enter.
4. You may be prompted for a username and password.  Your username is `itsyork\<username>` where `<username>` is your University of York IT Services username.  Your password is your IT Services password.
5. Once both your username and password have been entered hit enter to login.


## Troubleshooting

If you cannot login to the VPN then contact [IT Services](https://www.york.ac.uk/it-services/help/it-support/).

If you are connected to the VPN but having issues with getting to the folder, first try accessing it using an on-campus computer.  If you can access it there then [IT Services](https://www.york.ac.uk/it-services/help/it-support/) will likely be able to help. If you can't then please reach out to the Nouse Tech Team who will be able to check for any problems.

For any issues with personal installations of Adobe software, please login to your Creative Cloud account and follow the links for Support.  The Nouse Tech Team can only help with personal Adobe issues if it is to do with opening and saving files.
