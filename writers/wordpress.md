## WordPress
WordPress powers our website.  It's the tool we use to write new articles online as well as learn about their performance.

### Logging In
To login, click the Dashboard option at the bottom of any page.  Usernames are of the form "Firstname Lastname".  Your password is the value you have selected.  If it is your first time logging in to WordPress, you should follow the password reset procedure below.

Only tick the Remember Me box if you are the only user of that computer.

#### Password Reset
On the login screen, click the "Lost Password?" option at the bottom of the screen.  Enter your username and follow the instructions sent via email.  If you are a writer, then this will likely be your University of York email account.  If you are an editor, this will be your Nouse account.
