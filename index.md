## Welcome to Writers Room

Writers Room is here to make it easy for anyone who writes for Nouse to create and contribute content, as well as share important information.

Writers Room isn't the only way to get the information you need.  You can also

* Join our Facebook Groups
* Send us a DM on Twitter
* Email us
* Send us a letter (Yes, we still have a mailbox)

### Membership information
Any student at [University of York](https://www.york.ac.uk) can write for either our [website](https://www.nouse.co.uk/) or [print edition](https://www.nouse.co.uk/pdf-archive).  We also have a dedicated arts supplement called [Muse](https://www.nouse.co.uk/muse).  Before we can publish your work you need to have paid membership via [the YUSU website](https://www.yusu.org/groups/nouse/join).
