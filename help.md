## Getting Help
Following the simple steps below makes it easy for you to get the help you need using Nouse systems.

### Forgotten your Password?
If you've forgotten your password then you can start the reset process yourself.

* [https://www.nouse.co.uk/wordpress/wp-login.php?action=lostpassword](Reset your WordPress Password)
* [{{ "/editors/email" | prepend: site.baseurl }}](Reset your G Suite Password)

### Forgotten your Username?
Your username was sent to you in an email when your account was created.  You'll be able to find it there.

### Page not Loading?
The oldest advice in the book; turn it off and on again.  If you cannot view a page then try:

* Refreshing the page
* Closing and re-opening your browser
* Using a different browser
